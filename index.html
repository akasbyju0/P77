        <p>Visual Studio Code is a source-code editor made by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS. </p>
        <p>You can see what I have coded on the console screen. When you get to the website, right-click or double-click and
        click Inspect. After you press Inspect, press Console on the bar at the top. That's how you ge to see the
        project.</p>
